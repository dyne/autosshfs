#+TITLE: autosshfs -- Per user SSHFS automount using user's SSH config and keys.

* Introduction

  Autofs doesn't provide an easy way to mount SSHFS filesystems as a
  regular user.  HOWTOs abound on the topic, but rarely propose a
  solution involving the user's ssh-agent and password-protected keys.

  Autosshfs provides helper scripts to manage user automounts using
  =SSHFS= and =keychain=.

  This program was heavily inspired by Josh Jackson's autofs_sshfs,
  published at [[http://pturing.firehead.org/software/autofs_sshfs/]]

* Requirements

    - =sudo= privilege (for installation)
    - =ssh=, =sshfs=, =autofs=, =keychain=, =ssh-askpass=

* Quick Install

:    sudo apt-get install keychain ssh-askpass sshfs autofs
:    git clone https://github.com/hellekin/autosshfs.git
:    cd autosshfs && sudo make install
:    sudo autosshfs-user add $(id -un)

     If you don't already have an SSH key, create one now

:    if [ ! -r $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa ]; then ssh-keygen; fi

:    ssh-copy-id [user@]yourremotehost[:port]

    You *MUST* copy the public part of the SSH key to the
    user@yourremotehost's =.ssh/authorized_keys= file in order to
    allow password-less connections. =ssh-copy-id= will do that for
    you.  Connections will silently fail if your public key isn't
    known to the remote host (internally, the automount daemon will be
    waiting at a "Password: " prompt).

* Usage

:    ls ~/mnt/ssh/[user@]yourremotehost[:port]

    This will cause the autofs automount to attempt an SSH connection to 
      [user@]yourremotehost[:port]

    The values denoted by square brackets are optional.

    By default the connection to 'yourremotehost' will use the same
    user-name as you have on the localhost.  It is possible to specify
    a different user-name and a non-standard port for connections to
    'yourremotehost'.
    
    The following are all valid:

:    ls ~/mnt/ssh/yourremotehost
:    ls ~/mnt/ssh/yourremotehost:1234
:    ls ~/mnt/ssh/user@yourremotehost
:    ls ~/mnt/ssh/user@yourremotehost:1234
    
* Operation

    This section describes how the whole thing works.

** /etc/auto.master

    1. Each entry MUST point to under user's $HOME.  We assume it takes the form
:      /home/$USER/mnt/ssh/mountpoint
       In any other case it will break.

    2. UID and GID must match =id -u $USER= and =id -g $USER=

    3. $USER must be in group *autossh*

*** Example:

:   /home/joe/mnt/ssh program:/usr/local/sbin/autosshfs-map uid=1234,gid=1234,--timeout=600,--ghost

** autosshfs-user

    This program enables or disables the automount service for a user.

    Running =autosshfs-user add joe= will:

      - add =joe= to the =autosshfs= group
      - create a =autosshfs-as-joe= sudo wrapper for SSH
      - register the user automounter in =/etc/auto.master=
      - =restart autofs=

    Running =autosshfs-user del joe= will:

      - remove =joe= from the =autosshfs= group
      - remove the =autosshfs-as-joe= script
      - remove =joe='s entry in =/etc/auto.master=
      - =restart autofs=

** autosshfs-map

    Returns the =autofs= map for the requested host.

    Mountpoints are under =/home/$USER/mnt/ssh=

    The whole remote host's filesystem is mounted, only accessible to the user.

    The script is called from =/etc/auto.master=.

** autosshfs-ssh

    A wrapper to the =ssh= command that will force =automount= to use
    the user's SSH setup, including password-protected SSH keys, as
    long as they're available to the =keychain=.

    It is called by =autosshfs-as-joe= (using =sudo=) and loads
    =joe='s =keychain=.
