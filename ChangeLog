  * ChangeLog, VERSION: Version 0.3.0 -- Flying Edward (to safety)  This
  release adds support for ArchLinux, thanks to the precious help of
  @korakinos, and @jonbrett. (See pull #8) It does not bring new functionality
  other than being ready-to-use on non-Debian systems.  *  It occurs at an
  interesting moment in history, where a whistleblower name Edward Snowden is
  chased by the U.S.A. for leaking secrets about a global surveillance system
  operated by the NSA: PRISM. Today, in order to prevent Snowden from seeking
  asylum, the U.S.A. and its allies from Europe (Portugal, France, Italy, and
  Austria) are abusing the rules of diplomacy. They're threatening the life of
  President Evo Morales of Bolivia, by refusing their aerial space to his
  presidential plane on its way back from Russia, where Snowden found a
  temporary refuge, on the suspicion that the whistleblower might be on board. 
  That is unprecedented, and as in the reclusion of Julian Assange,
  demonstrates once again the unilaterality of the "democratic rule", where a
  pseudo-democratic-superpower-gone-out-of-control respects or violates
  diplomacy, human rights, or the Constitution as it sees fit.  The best weapon
  of a dictatorship is secrecy, but the best weapon of a democracy should be
  the weapon of openness. -- Niels Bohr

  src/ssh-wrapper.heredoc: New version: more secure and to the point.

  * Makefile, bin/autosshfs-map, bin/autosshfs-ssh, bin/autosshfs-user: Add
  dedicated group and narrow the scope of commands  Now we're using a dedicated
  group called 'autosshfs'.  I reduced the scope of autosshfs commands to
  prevent malicious uses (e.g. trying to ssh to a host as the user):  [1]
  autosshfs-as-user only passes the host instead of the whole ssh line provided
  by automount [2] autosshfs-ssh hardcodes the ssh command to prevent passing
  extra options to ssh [3] only root can run the commands [4] unauthorized use
  is logged  [2] and [4] are not yet foolproof.
